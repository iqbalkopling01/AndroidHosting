Open the app and choose Ubuntu 
![Setup Step 1](s/1.png)

Give the permission needed
![Setup Step 2](s/2.png)
![Setup Step 3](s/3.png)

Choose minimal environtment
![Setup Step 4](s/4.png)

Choose Terminal GUI only so that the server would run smoothly even just running on an android mobile phone
![Setup Step 5](s/5.png)
![Setup Step 6](s/6.png)

Wait till the process done. Once the process done, the terminal screen will appear.

![Setup Step 8](s/8.png)

Netx, update the password on your server by typing passwd. Type your password 2 times.
![Setup Step 9](s/9.png)

Before beginning any installs, update and upgrade the repository if you haven't already. 
sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y	
![Setup Step 10](s/10.png)![Setup Step 10](s/10.png)

Next, install neofetch to verified the version of operating system used.
apt install neofetch -y
![Server Config 1](s/11.png)

Verify the installation by typing neofetch
![Server Config 2](s/12.png)

Install net-tools to check device‚Äôs IP address. (Author was already installed net-tools)
apt install net-tools -y
![Server Config 3](s/13.png)

Check device‚Äôs IP address using ifconfig. Numbers after ‚Äòinet‚Äô is the device‚Äôs IP. Write or just remember it. It will be used later.
![Server Config 4](s/14.png)

Configuring The Web Server: Web server used on this project is Nginx. 
apt install nginx -y 
![Server Config 5](s/15.png)

Next, verify the status of nginx (at first, it will show that nginx is not running, but it‚Äôs not a problem because nginx is not started yet). Nginx need more configuration and text editor choosen is nano.
service nginx status
apt install nano -y
![Server Config 6](s/16.png)

Next configuration for nginx is changing the default port to 8080. To do this, use command below.
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
![Server Config 7](s/17.png)

Change ‚Äú80‚Äù to 8080. Click CTRL+X, then press Y, and press Enter button on keyboard to exit from nano and back to terminal.
Next, restart nginx service. Once it‚Äôs done restarting, it will show [OK].
service nginx restart
![Server Config 8](s/18.png)

Verify the service by accessing device‚Äôs IP:8080 on browser. 
Example: 192.168.1.2:8080
![Server Config 9](s/19.png)

The web server is already working. Next, for changing the welcoming page. Go to default web page‚Äôs directory by using comand below.
cd /var/www/html 
![Server Config 10](s/20.png)

There will be a default file: index.nginx-debian.html. Remove it by command below.
rm -r index.nginx-debian.html

### 4. Cloudflare Tunnel (Zero Trust)
Create tunnel, bind public hostname to `localhost:8080`, validate with domain.

### 5. Blog Deployment
- Create static HTML/CSS site
- Upload to GitHub
- Clone repo to `/var/www/html`
- Use `git pull` to update
- 
## ‚úÖ Project Outcome
### üéØ Goals Achieved
- Static blog hosted successfully on private server
### üîê Security and Reliability
- Cloudflare hides real IP
- Zero Trust ensures validated access
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- Android hardware limits performance
- UserLand setup is complex
### üí° Future Recommendations
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Web performance optimization
